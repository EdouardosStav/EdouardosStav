✨ About Me
I'm a Technology Consultant and AI Engineer focused on building intelligent, cloud-native solutions that drive real business value.
I bring a hybrid background in software engineering, AI development, and digital transformation strategy.

With experience across startup and enterprise settings—from launching NegotAI, to delivering financial SaaS at Fenergo, to IT assurance at PwC—I approach problems holistically, delivering systems that are scalable, reliable, and aligned with business objectives.

🔧 What I Can Bring to the Table
• 🧠 AI Systems & Automation
From intelligent workflow automation to data-driven insights, I build AI solutions that solve real-world problems using Python, OpenAI APIs, and ML frameworks.

• ☁️ Cloud-Native Engineering
I develop robust backends and scalable APIs using tools like Supabase, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, and AWS. My solutions are built to scale across B2B and B2C use cases.

• 🧩 Consulting-Grade Problem Solving
From PwC to Fenergo, I’ve worked cross-functionally with business and tech teams to align implementation with business needs, reduce inefficiencies, and deliver results.

💡 Looking Ahead
I'm open to opportunities in AI consulting, cloud strategy, or full-stack product roles—especially where innovation meets impact.
If you’re looking for someone who bridges the gap between engineering and business transformation, let’s connect! 🤝
